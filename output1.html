                <p><b>Ques.</b> How many ways are there to place a black and a white knight on an N * M chessboard such that they do not attack each other? The knights have to be placed on different squares. A knight can move two squares horizontally and
                    one square vertically (L shaped), or two squares vertically and one square horizontally (L shaped). The knights attack each other if one can reach the other in one move. Find output for N=2, M=3.</p>

                    between li and ri, inclusive, to be called normal. Now, Pasha thinks that a Platelet count is Safe to have if at least Z Doctors recommend it. Pasha now asks Q Queries. In each query- he will give an integer P (the platelet count).
                    Pasha wants to know if the entered Platelet count is safe to have or not. N=5; li and ri for 5 doctors: 1 10, 5 10, 7 12, 15 25, 20 25; Z=3; Q=4; 4 query platelets: 7, 5, 10, 16. Output Yes/No for each query patelest.
